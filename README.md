# Georgia Tech Full Stack Bootcamp Project 2
=====================

### Parse.ly :seedling:

An application to survey people looking to become house plant hobbyists that will match you to customized results based off your lifestyle, skill, and preferences. You will choose from your survey results and get a customized box sent to you with instructions.

### Technologies Used

- Flexbox-Grid CSS Library
- jQuery
- Express
- Sequelize
- Nightmare & Cheerio (webscraping)

### Challenges

- Some database results came back with multiple values
- Our survey results didn't match all data types in our database, we came up with way to translate the logic to compare the results and return the correct data

### Improvements

- Forum: integrate a forum-like feature where users can share feedback, personal experiences with specific plants, share tips & tricks of plant care
- User validation/login: add validation layer to allow users to create an account to store and save plants for future purchase
- Search all/filter: add another HTML page to view all plants in database, add method to filter so that user may search and see all plants in specified data type
